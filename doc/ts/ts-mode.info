1 Introduction
**************

This manual describes TS mode, which extends Emacs with functionality
for editing TypoScript files.

   GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor and can be
obtained for free from `http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/'. *Note
Preface: (emacs)Top. The code is written and tested on GNU Emacs
version 23.1.1.


File: ts-mode.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Using TS mode,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Installation
**************

To install TypoScript Mode just drop file `ts-mode.el' into a directory
on your load-path. If you are the administrator of the system you are
working on, a possible directory could be
`/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/skampi-mode', for example. You might
byte-compile it for better performance. *Note Byte Compilation:
(elisp)Byte Compilation.

   To set up Emacs to automatically edit files ending in `.ts' using
TypoScript Mode, add the following lines to your `~/.emacs' file (GNU
Emacs) or `~/.xemacs/init.el' file (XEmacs):
     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ts$" . ts-mode) auto-mode-alist))
     (autoload 'ts-mode "ts-mode" "TypoScript input file editing mode." t)
   If you just want to test TypoScript Mode or are not eager to modify
your `~/.emacs' file, type `M-x load-file', load the `ts-mode.el' file
and finally apply the mode to the current buffer by typing `M-x
ts-mode'.

3 Using T3PHP mode
******************

TypoScript Mode supports different display and editing features, which
will be described in the following sections.

* Syntax highlighting::
* Line indentation::
* Folding::


File: ts-mode.info,  Node: Customization,  Next: Syntax highlighting,  Up: Using TS mode

3.1 Customization
=================

TypoScript Mode defines a customization group in Emacs, which is a
member of the Emacs standard customization group `Languages', whose
parent Emacs group is `Programming'. Use `M-x customize' to browse
through the full list of customization groups or `M-x customize-group'
with parameter `typoscript' to enter the TypoScript Mode customization
group directly

The following user-customizable variables are provided.

 -- Variable: integer t3php-block-indentation
     The indentation relative to a predecessing line which begins a new
     code block.

     Default: `4'

 -- Variable: choice ts-newline-function
     This variable decides which function to call upon pressing
     `<RET>'. Depending on the chosen option, line indentation will be
     processed automatically. The following options are available for
     CHOICE:
    `newline'
          This command just inserts newlines into the current buffer
          before point.

    `newline-and-indent'
          This function inserts a newline(1), then indents the new line
          (the one following the newline just inserted) according to
          TypoScript Mode's internal indentation strategies.

    `reindent-then-newline-and-indent'
          This command reindents the current line, inserts a newline at
          point, and then indents the new line (the one following the
          newline just inserted).

     Default: `newline'.

 -- Variable: color ts-fold-foreground-color
     The foreground color used to highlight a folded block.

     Default: `white'.

 -- Variable: color ts-fold-background-color
     The background color used to highlight a folded block.

     Default: `DodgerBlue1'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note the different meanings of _newline_ and _new line_, that
goes with their different spellings. _newline_ refers to the code
representation of a new line, while _new line_ means its interpretation
as a visible new line in the editor after pressing `<RET>'.

3.2 Syntax highlighting
=======================

Syntax highlighting is a convenient feature of an editor to improve the
appearance hence the readability of code. TypoScript Mode supports the
highlighting of single line and multiline comments, keywords and several
syntactic structures.

   In XEmacs syntax highlighting should be enabled automatically. In GNU
Emacs you may have to add these lines to your `~/.emacs' file:
     (global-font-lock-mode t)
     (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)


File: ts-mode.info,  Node: Line indentation,  Next: Folding,  Prev: Syntax highlighting,  Up: Using TS mode

3.3 Line indentation
====================

A TypoScript code line is indented automatically when the <TAB> key is
pressed while point is on the according line. The indentation takes
place with respect to the indentation of previous lines. *Note
Customization::, for details. The default width is `4'.

   Depending on the current value of the customizable variable
TS-NEWLINE-FUNCTION, line indentation might be executed automatically
after pressing `<RET>'. *Note Customization::, for details.

   Furthermore the characters `}' (closing parenthesis) and `)'
(closing brace) are _electric_, i.e. they are indented automatically
after insertion.

3.4 Folding
===========

Emacs is able to alter the appearance of a buffer's text on the screen,
for the sake of presentation features, with so called "overlays". In
TypoScript Mode this mechanism is used to "fold" TypoScript blocks like
1 page.10 {
2     table = tt_content
3     select {
4         pidInList = this
5         orderBy = sorting
6     }
7 }
   to a single non editable line containing only the name of the
TypoScript block, if point is on the `select' line.
1 page.10 {
2     table = tt_content
3     [select]
4     }
5 }
   These string replacements are highlighted with dedicated foreground
and background colors, which can of course be customized. *Note
Customization::, for details. The default color combination is `white'
text on an `DodgerBlue1' background.

The following commands are implemented to "fold" and "unfold"
measurement blocks.

 -- Interactive Command: ts-fold-block
     Fold the innermost block with respect to point position.

     Key binding: `C-c C-e'

 -- Interactive Command: ts-unfold-block
     Unfold the folded block at point.

     Key binding: `C-c C-a'

 -- Interactive Command: ts-unfold-region start end
     Unfold every folded measurement block, which is placed within a
     region limited by mark and point.

     Key binding: `C-c C-u C-r'

 -- Interactive Command: ts-unfold-buffer
     Unfold every folded block in the current buffer.

     Key binding: `C-c C-u C-b'
